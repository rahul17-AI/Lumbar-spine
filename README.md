# Lumbar-spine
This project uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for unsupervised segmentation of lumbar spine MRI images and evaluates results using standard performance metrics. Lumbar Lordotic Angle (LLA) values are integrated to classify spinal curvature into Hyperlordosis, Hypolordosis, or Normal.

📌 Project Overview😎

This project implements an automated medical image analysis pipeline for lumbar spine MRI segmentation using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), combined with Lumbar Lordotic Angle (LLA) based classification for spinal curvature assessment. The approach leverages unsupervised probabilistic clustering to segment anatomical structures without requiring labeled training data.
The system also performs quantitative evaluation against ground truth masks using widely accepted segmentation metrics, making it suitable for academic research, experimentation, and educational purposes in medical imaging and healthcare AI.

🎯 Objectives

👉 Perform unsupervised segmentation of lumbar spine MRI images
👉 Evaluate segmentation accuracy using standard medical imaging metrics
👉 Integrate clinical measurement (LLA) for lordosis classification
👉 Demonstrate practical use of probabilistic machine learning in healthcare

🧠 Methodology / How It Works

The pipeline follows these major steps:👇

1️⃣ Image Acquisition
MRI images, ground truth masks, and optional pseudo images are uploaded.
Images may be grayscale or RGB.

2️⃣ Preprocessing
Convert RGB images → grayscale
Normalize pixel intensities to [0, 1]
Flatten image into a feature vector for clustering

3️⃣ Gaussian Mixture Model Segmentation
A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is fitted on pixel intensities.
GMM assumes image intensities arise from multiple Gaussian distributions.
Each pixel is assigned to the most probable Gaussian component.
Output → Segmented image with multiple tissue clusters.

4️⃣ Ground Truth Alignment
Ground truth masks are resized to match segmentation dimensions.
Binary thresholding ensures valid comparison.

5️⃣ Performance Evaluation
The segmentation is validated using:
Accuracy Score
F1 Score (Macro)
Dice Coefficient
Jaccard Index (IoU)
Hausdorff Distance
These metrics capture both region overlap and boundary similarity.

6️⃣ Lordosis Classification
Lumbar Lordotic Angle (LLA) values are read from an Excel sheet.
Classification rules:
LLA Range	Classification
LLA > 45°	Hyperlordosis
LLA < 20°	Hypolordosis
Otherwise	Normal
